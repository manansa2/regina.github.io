      <description>When I say I had an exhausting year, I’m not lying.
I quit my job and started a new one - TWICE  I went through a bit of a crisis earlier in the year. The thought of giving up my career gave me so much anxiety so I frantically searched for jobs that would allow me to work from another country. A recruiter contacted me and I was offered a Data Scientist position with a 25% salary increase, but I didn’t want to take it because I knew I was leaving at some point.</description>

      <description>I’ve had an Apple Watch for a while now and I bought it largely because I wanted to start tracking my activity – and to, eventually, analyze this data. In order to do the latter, though, I needed to have owned, worn, and religiously tracked activities using my watch for at least 1 whole calendar year. Now in the summer of 2020, I had some down time and so I downloaded my watch data and started messing around with it.</description>
