      <description>Finally! This blog was over a year in the making, but I finally managed to get it to work. It took me a REALLY long time to realize that my dissatisfaction with my GitHub username was causing all the blog deployment hiccups.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been intending to start a blog as a showcase or dumping site of sorts. It might be a slow start because I&amp;rsquo;m learning the intricacies of blogdown and GitHub, as well as deciding on how to appropriately structure my content without becoming a huge mess.</description>
