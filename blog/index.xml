      <description>I’ve had an Apple Watch for a while now and I bought it largely because I wanted to start tracking my activity – and to, eventually, analyze this data. In order to do the latter, though, I needed to have owned, worn, and religiously tracked activities using my watch for at least 1 whole calendar year. Now in the summer of 2020, I had some down time and so I downloaded my watch data and started messing around with it.</description>

Over the summer, the members of my lab had the opportunity to audit UW-Milwaukee’s Introduction to Programming class. It was 8 weeks long and entirely online. This was my first time ever taking a class online that wasn’t one those free online short courses from Coursera or FutureLearn. In the weeks prior, I was witness to my sister’s abrupt transition to online classes due to Covid-19 so I expected my course follow a similar format as hers - set lecture times where you watch a video or slideshow with a professor’s voiceover, small group discussion sections, and online homework questionnaires/assignments.</description>

      <description>Finally! This blog was over a year in the making, but I finally managed to get it to work. It took me a REALLY long time to realize that my dissatisfaction with my GitHub username was causing all the blog deployment hiccups.
I’ve been intending to start a blog as a showcase or dumping site of sorts. It might be a slow start because I’m learning the intricacies of blogdown and GitHub, as well as deciding on how to appropriately structure my content without becoming a huge mess.</description>
