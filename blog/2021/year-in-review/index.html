<p>When I say I had an exhausting year, I’m not lying.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I quit my job and started a new one - TWICE</li>
</ol>
<p>I went through a bit of a crisis earlier in the year. The thought of giving up my career gave me so much anxiety so I frantically searched for jobs that would allow me to work from another country. A recruiter contacted me and I was offered a Data Scientist position with a 25% salary increase, but I didn’t want to take it because I knew I was leaving at some point. I ultimately accepted the offer because 1) my boss was leaving UWM which meant I’d be unemployed starting in August and 2) I had health issues I had to address.</p>
<p>Fast forward to October, I quit my Data Science job and went through another crisis trying to find a European company that would hire an American without a guaranteed work permit. There were big organizations interested, but none willing to accommodate the uncertainty of my situation. I eventually got 2 offers - one as a researcher and another as a PhD student. I never imagined I’d be doing a PhD at this point in my life.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Everyone in my family moved at least once</li>
</ol>
<p>I left the apartment I lived in since June 2017 and moved in with my mom. It was my first place on my own; it was bittersweet. I gave all my furniture to my sister, who was also moving to a new apartment in college. She moved 2 days after my surgery (see below). My mom moved to a cheaper apartment also the same month as my surgery. In November, I moved to Belgium.</p>
<p>Taking stock of everything I own and finding the most appropriate ways to dispose of all the dumb things I’ve accumulated was hell. Never again.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I had my first major surgery</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2018, I found out I had a fibroid in my uterus. In 2019, I found out I had a second one. In 2020, I had an MRI and found out I had 4 and they were continuing to grow. In 2021, I had them removed along with endometriosis that had built up in my organs for the past 22 years.</p>
<p>The past 3 years of bleeding, back pain, cramps, migraines, anxiety, and mood changes were debilitating. I cancelled or backed out of plans because of my period. I couldn’t work on the days I had my period. Some of my best memories are overshadowed by my period. I’m still not 100%, but I am hopeful it gets better.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Milwaukee Bucks are NBA champs</li>
</ol>
<p>I had the best summer full of fun and friends. I was sober for most of it, but it was amazing. I love Milwaukee forever.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I planned a pandemic wedding</li>
</ol>
<p>I found out I was getting married 2 days before I picked up all my belongings and got on my one-way flight Belgium.</p>
<p>We booked a venue and decided on a wedding date in December 2020. We decided to plan it all ourselves and the party planning was unnervingly easy at the start, especially with the sense of optimism that came with the vaccines.</p>
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I got vaccinated 4 times (one for the flu, three for covid)</li>
</ol>
